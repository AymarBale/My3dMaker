Left To Do 
-other image
-rule testing

group :
    GROUPNAME(value){
    valAxis: value;
    axis: value;
    Corner: {[value,value],[value,value],[value,value],[value,value],[value,value]};
    batch: value;
    color: value;
    }
    used to modify an image in their undisclosed axis example if the axis is X and Y
    you can modify it the Z axis of the image using this syntax

Rules:
    GROUPNAME(test){
    valAxis: 3;
    axis: X;
    Corner: {[20,20],[20,40],[40,40],[40,20]};
    batch: 11;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    rules: {[1 ++ only|20,25|30,25]};
    }
    the rules are a more advanced variations of the groups that can allow you to modify
    the undisclosed axis inside a group .You can add this line:
        rules: {[1 ++ only|20,25|30,25]};
    the first part : 1 ++ only mean that we had one to the position of each tracker in the
    undisclosed axis but incrementally so first 1 will be added then 2 then 3.Only mean that
    we just want to apply it to this line.
    the other two part are just the beginning and the end of the rule.
     another variation will be :
        rules: {[1 + all|20,25|30,25]};
        So in this case we just had one to the position of each tracker in the
        undisclosed axis .
batch:
    batchRp(value){
      UAxis:value;
      X:value;
      Z:value;
      id:value;
    }
    use to modify the image imported in their axis
QI(quick import):
    {
    path:C:\\Users\\aymar\\Downloads\\pig3d\\pigTop.png;
    chosenAxe:Y;
    additive:14.11;
    val:8.4,8.4,9,8;
    }
    use to import image without using the editor;
line Separation:
    Line separation is used to execute one part after the other so the part on top of the
    line will be executed then the bottom half it can be useful when dealing with the
    batch that changes the position of the groups therefore will render their application
    useless.
